## Assignment Overview

This assignment is designed to help you master core concepts in statistics through hands-on programming exercises. You will:

- Generate and analyze datasets
- Implement statistical functions (mean, median, mode, etc.)
- Visualize data distributions
- Perform hypothesis tests (z-test, t-test, chi-square, ANOVA)
- Work with probability distributions
- Analyze real-world datasets (e.g., Seaborn's `tips` dataset)

Each question is implemented in Python, with clear explanations and code comments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (recommended)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or install individually:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy seaborn matplotlib
```

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/statistics-assignment.git
    cd statistics-assignment
    ```

2. **Install dependencies** (see above).

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the main notebook (e.g., `Statistics_Assignment.ipynb`) and follow the sections for each question.

## Assignment Structure

The assignment is divided into the following sections:

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Generate integer lists and compute mean, median, mode
- Weighted mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean, midrange, trimmed mean

### 2. Data Visualization & Dispersion
- Visualize distributions (histogram, KDE, Gaussian)
- Calculate range, variance, standard deviation, IQR, coefficient of variation, MAD, quartile deviation, coefficient of dispersion

### 3. Probability & Random Variables
- Discrete random variable class (expected value, variance)
- Simulate dice rolls and probability distributions (binomial, Poisson, Gaussian)
- Compute PDF, CDF, PMF

### 4. Real Dataset Analysis
- Use Seaborn's `tips` dataset
- Skewness, covariance, Pearson correlation, scatter plots

### 5. Hypothesis Testing
- Z-tests: website conversion, tutoring program, drug effectiveness, customer service response time
- T-tests: A/B testing, drug comparison, intervention analysis, salary gap, product quality, customer satisfaction

### 6. Categorical Data Analysis
- Chi-square tests: association between age and voter preference, product satisfaction and region, job performance before/after training

### 7. ANOVA
- Compare customer satisfaction across multiple product versions
